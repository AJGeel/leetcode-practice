# Leetcode Practice

These are a number of front-end exercises to practice potential interview questions. Rather than `leetcode`, trivia-style questions on algorithms, these exercises are more representative of the role of a front-end developer, addressing the fields of system design and practical front-end coding.

Originally, these practice questions were shared by /u/jayrobin on Reddit. These solutions were created by Arthur Geel, based on mainly vanilla JS.
